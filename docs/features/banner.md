# Server Banner

Show the most active user in the server banner.

- Use `/banner` to get started.

!!! info
    Discord required **server level 2** for banners. If your server does not meet this requirement,
    you can send the banner message in a **text channel** instead.

## Customization
The banner image is **highly customizable** and can include various elements. You can also specify
a **role** for the most active user to receive.
